# Intro to Tutorials

Tutorials are step-by-step articles that tell beginners exactly _what_ to do, not _how_ or _why_ to do it.&#x20;

They do not give users options or force the user to make decisions.

They focus on a specific scenario with a predefined outcome that helps the user understand whether they've accomplished the task.&#x20;
